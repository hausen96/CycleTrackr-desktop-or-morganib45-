# Privacy & Data Policy
- This is a local desktop app.
- After the user authorizes via Strava OAuth, the app stores the access/refresh tokens
  **locally** in a SQLite database on the same machine (no server).
- The app reads activity data to display stats/goals; it does not upload activities or
  post on behalf of users.
- On logout, the app deletes the stored tokens and cached Strava data. Users can also
  revoke access from Strava: Settings â†’ My Apps.
- Contact: <hsnzenons@gmail.com> for questions or deletion requests.
